Gosh doesn't it seem like a million years ago?,CALM
I have no idea. But look how much they spent!,ENERGETIC
I know. It's just such reckless spending.,SAD

I know that one! ...No that's Popes into a Volkswagen.,HAPPY
Yeah but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean it's a total party zoo.,CALM

I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?,CALM
Uh-huh.,CALM
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like kid wait a year leave home do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought 'Now that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.,HAPPY
Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.,CALM
I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.,CALM
