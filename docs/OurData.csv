Uh-huh.,CALM
I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like kid wait a year leave home do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought 'Now that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back.' And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do.,HAPPY
